<h3 id="Midway"><a href="https://midwaygolfgames.com/">Midway Golf and Games</a> is a fast growing, family friendly, recreation facility on the west side of the city of Columbia. I had the opportunity to work there for two summers and almost two years. The facility consists of a driving range, par 3 course, mini golf course, go-kart track and more! My first summer there I helped out with the front counter and with group events. Like most jobs the longer you stay with a company the more responsibilites you acquire and new skills you learn. By the end of the summer I was mainly spending time working the counter helping guests, leading group events or doing a variety of daily upkeep tasks such as driving the golf ball picker on the range or watering the greens.</h3>

<h3 id="Midway2">My second summer I took on more responsibility and started to work with some of there social media platforms. I created a snapchat filter for the company and started a research project of my own. I&#8217;ve taken a personal interest in media marketing and social media marketing. I conducted surveys throughout the summer asking people questions such as; if they follow us on social media or have seen/heard Midway&#8217;s TV/Radio advertisements. I would then record the information and ask for their zipcode. I saved all of this information throughout the summer to provide feedback on the companies customer base and provided feedback on their consumers involvement with their advertising efforts.</h3>

<h3 id="referee_official"><em>Referee/Official</em></h3>

<h4 id="MizRec3">Early in my Sophomore year of college I decided to take a class on officiating through Mizzou as I had talked about the possibility of doing it on the side of my other part-time jobs. I took the class and thoughourly enjoyed it. I spoke with my professor and took a job at Mizzou Rec as a Rec Sports official. I worked at the Rec officating basketball for around 2 1/2 months before the entire school year was cut short with the start of the covid-19 pandemic. Although my time was cut short at the rec I eventually registered as an official through <a href="https://www.mshsaa.org/">MSHSAA</a> the following summer. Since that time I have officated numerous Jr. High and Junior Varsity football and basketball contests throughout Mid-Missouri.</h4>
