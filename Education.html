<h4 id="PRST">When I came to Mizzou in the fall of &#8216;18 I was originally an Agribusiness Management Major, but after my first semester I began looking into other majors as my interests began to change as many people&#8217;s do when they first arrive at school. I had switched around to a variety of different majors for around a year from Business, Marketing, Communications, etc. and finally decided that I wanted to have a major with classes I was interested in and that also had some insight on agriculture and natural resources which is what I was used to growing up in rural Northeast Missouri. After looking at almost every school in the University and what they had to offer I chose to switch to Parks, Recreation &amp; Sport. This major gave me an opportunity to take a variety of classes such as Sport&#8217;s Marketing, Business of Sport, Park Planning and Design, and even a forestry class evaulating Missouri&#8217;s trees and our state&#8217;s land management systems.</h4>

<h4 id="IT">A semester before graduating the Job Market was very rough for jobs within the Parks, Recreation &amp; Sport and I was desperate to find a career path or educational path for the upcomming year. I was looking at different graduate programs for Data Analytics and Web Development (mainly at Kansas State) and after doing more and more research I came across the University of Missouri&#8217;s Information Technology Program. Realizing that this program offered everything I was interested in, I decided to pursue this degree. So far this program has been beyond my expectations for what I was looking to learn and am excited that I took a risk and found myself going down the right path.</h4>
